  Hi everyone! As you probably know Sean and I got married on December 12 of 2014 in San Francisco. We had a beautiful small ceremony with our parents and some of our closest friends.
 
  We really wanted to be able to get to celebrate with all of you and have our American and Italian friends and families meet and get to know each other. We would love to have you at our wedding reception in Italy.
  
  We will be using this website to post information about the ceremony, accommodation, travel info and anything we things might be useful for you.
We will update it with more details as we get closer to the date, so come back and check from time to time. Donâ€™t forget to RSVP and shoot us an email if you have any question!
