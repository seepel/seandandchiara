#### Flying
  If you are flying internationally, the easiest and fastest option is to fly into Turin (Torino Caselle Airport, TRN).
There are no direct flights from the US to Turin, so you will have to stop over in a bigger hub somewhere in Europe.

  Alternatively, you could:

 * fly into Nice, France, which is a 2.5 hours drive
 * fly into Milan, Italy (MXP), take a coach to Turin, take a train to Savigliano (twon near Saluzzo). More details to come for this option.
