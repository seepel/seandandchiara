#### Taxi

  If you don’t want to go through the hassle of renting a car or taking public transport, you can always take a taxi. It will cost you around €100 one way from Turin and around €260 from Milano Malpensa.
  You can either take one of the taxis at the airport or get in touch ahead of time with one of the taxi services from Saluzzo:
