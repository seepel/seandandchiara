#### Flying
  If you are flying internationally, the easiest and fastest option is to fly into Turin.
There are no direct flights from the US to Turin, so you will have to stop over in a bigger hub in Europe. Alternatively, you could fly into Nice, (France) or Milan (Italy) which are a little more than 2 hours away by car from Saluzzo.
