  We really appreciate you coming from far away to celebrate with us, so the nights of June 26-27 are on us!  
We have booked 2 blocks of rooms for June 26-27 in two hotels in Saluzzo.  
You just need to choose one and let us know at [wedding@seanandchiara.com](mailto:wedding@seanandchiara.com) and we will take care of the booking. If you already have even just a vague idea of which days you'll need an accommodation for, please let us know asap. There's another wedding in town that day and hotels get very pretty with toruists in summer and we want to make sure you can stay in Saluzzo so you won't necessarily need a car.
