  2015 is a great year to visit Italy, since many cities are hosting important events like the [Expo 2015](http://www.expo2015.org/en/index.html?packedargs=op=changeLang) in Milan and the [Holy Shroud Exposition](http://www.sindone.org/the_holy_shroud__english_/online_reservations_and_call_/00024633_Reservation.html) in Turin. In June the weather is nice, yet not too hot (around 68-80 F) and tourist attractions are not excessively crowded (yet!).

  In Italy, people go out for drinks before dinner, and from 06:30 -9:00 most cocktails bars offer Aperitivo: you pay a little more for your drink but you can have access to the all-you-eat buffet of finger food from the counter.  
The most typical Aperitivo drink is Spritz: Aperol liquer, Prosecco white wine and seltzer water.
