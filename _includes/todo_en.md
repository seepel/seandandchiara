##### Where to have a drink
  In Italy, people go out for drinks before dinner, and from 06:30 -9:00 most cocktails bars offer Aperitivo: you pay a little more for your drink but you can have access to the all-you-eat buffet of finger food from the counter.  
The most typical Aperitivo drink is Spritz: Aperol liquer, Prosecco white wine and seltzer water.

##### Italian Coffee anyone?
 Note that in Italy filter coffee is not common and the closest to American style coffee you can get is an Americano. However you can enjoy delicious espressos, cappuccino and macchiatos!
