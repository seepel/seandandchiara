**Pro tip**: in Italy, instead of Happy Hour, bars offer "Aperitivo" from 06:30 - 9:00pm. You pay a little more for your drink but you can have access to the all-you-eat buffet of finger food from the counter.  
The most typical Aperitivo drink is Spritz: Aperol liquer, Prosecco white wine and seltzer water.
